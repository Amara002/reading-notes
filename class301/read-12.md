# sql vs nosql

1. ***Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:***

- **SQL**
1. **Relational Databases**  	
2. **Table based databases** 	
3. **Have predefined schema**	
4. **Vertically scalable** 	

- **NoSQL**
1. **Non-relational or distributed database.**
2. **Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases**
3. **Have dynamic schema for unstructured data**
4. **Horizontally scalable**

2. ***What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?***
- **highly structured data**

3. ***Give a real world example.***
- **MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.**

4. ***What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?***
- **NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.**

5. ***Give a real world example.***
- **MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb**

6. ***Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?***
- **NoSQL**

7. ***Which type of database is best for scalability?***
- **NoSQL databases**




# sql vs nosql

1. ***What does SQL stand for?**
- **Structured Query Language.**

2. ***What is a realational database?***
- **A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.**

3. ***What type of structure does a relational database work with?***
- **One-to-One One-to-Many Many-to-Many**

4. ***What is a ‘schema’?***
- **Schema is a framework or paradigm for the organization and interpretation of information.**

5. ***What is a NoSQL database?***
- **which stands for “not only SQL,” is an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational databases.**

6. ***Howo does it work?***
- **Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models.**

7. ***What is inside of a Mongo database?***
- **Documents & collections**

9. ***What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?***
- **NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).**
