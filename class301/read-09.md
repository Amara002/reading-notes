# Functional Programming Concepts


1. **What is functional programming?**
***Functional programming (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects.***

2. **What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

3. **What are the benefits of a pure function?**
4. **What is immutability?**
5. **What is Referential transparency?**
