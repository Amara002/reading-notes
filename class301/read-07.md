# REST

1. **Who is Roy Fielding?**
***He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser.***

2. **Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**
***We need to be able to talk to all machines about all the stuff that's on all the other machines. So we need some way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine.***

3. **What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**
***he helped write, HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason. hat first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.***

4. **What does a GET do?**
***Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.***

5. **What does a POST do?**
***If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.***

6. **What does PUT do?**
***If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT***

7. **What does PATCH do?**
***to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.***
