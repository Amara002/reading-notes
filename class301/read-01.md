# Component Based Architecture


1. **What is a component?**
***A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.***

2. **What are the charactistics of a component?**

 - ***Reusability : Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.***

- ***Replaceable : Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.***

- ***Not context specific : Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.***

- ***Extensible : A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.***

- ***Encapsulated : A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.***

- ***Independent : Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.***

3. **What are the advantages of using component based architecture?**

- ***Ease of deployment (no conflicts when updating the version to a new one)***
- ***Reduced cost (when you use a third party component it will reduce the cost of development and maintenance)***
- ***Ease of development (when you use a component with good code it will not affect other components in your system)***
- ***Reusable (you can use the same component in other systems and applications)***
- ***Modification of technical complexity***
- ***Reliability (when each component is reliable, then the reliability of the whole system will improve)***
- ***System maintenance and evolution (you can edit and change the component easily without affecting the rest components in your system)***
- ***Independent (each component designed to have a minimal limit of dependencies of other components)***
