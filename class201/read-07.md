# Tables
***A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.***

## Basic Table Structure
- ***The '< table >' element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.***
- ***Each cell of a table is represented using a '< td >' element. (The td stands for table data.)***
- ***You indicate the start of each row using the opening '< tr >' tag. (The tr stands for table row.)***
- ***The '< th >' element is used just like the '< td >' element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.)***
- ***Spanning ColumnS: Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column.*** 
- ***Spanning Rows: You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row.***
-***Long Tables: The headings of the table should sit inside the '< thead >' element. and The body should sit inside the '< tbody >' element. and The footer belongs inside the '< tfoot >' element.***

# CREATING MANY OBJECTS: 
- ***CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION: Sometimes you will want several objects to represent similar things. Object constructors can use a function as a template for creating objects. First, create the template with the object's properties and methods.***
- ***CONSTRUCTOR SYNTAX: (If the object already had any of these properties, this would overwrite the values in those properties.) To access a property of this object, you can use dot notation, just as you can with any object.***

## STORING DATA
***In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.***

## OBJECT MODEL
***The topmost object in the Document Object Model (or DOM) is the document object. It represents the webpage loaded into the current browser window or tab.*** 

> **Note: JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.**
