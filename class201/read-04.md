# Links
***Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another.***

## Writing Links
**Links are created using the '< a >' element. Users can click on anything between the opening '< a >' tag and the closing '< /a >' tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.**

## Email Links
**mailto: To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the   '< a >'element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.**

## Opening Links in a New Window
**target: If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the target attribute on the opening '< a >' tag. The value of this attribute should be _blank.**

# Layout

## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
**CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.**

## Controlling the Position of Elements
- **Normal flow**
- **Relative Positioning**
- **Absolute positioning**
- **Fixed Positioning**
- **Floating Elements**

## Over lapping Elements
**z-index: When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.**

## Floating Element
**float: The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.**

## Page Sizes
**Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).**

## Fixed Width Layouts
**Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.**

## Liquid Layouts
**Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.**

## Layout Grids
**Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.**

## CSS Frameworks
**CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.**

## Multiple Style sheets
**link: On this page you can see the other technique for including multiple style sheets. Inside the '< head >' element is a separate '< link >' element for each style sheet.**

# Functions
***Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).***

## ANONYMOUS FUNCTIONS
**A function declaration creates a function that you can call later in your code. In order to call the function later in your code, you must give it a name, so these are known as named functions.**

## FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS 
**If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an expression, and it is known as a function expression**
