# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
***Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.***

- **If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property.**
- **If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.**

# Literal notation
- ***Literal notation is the easiest and most popular way to create objects.***
- ***Dot notation means you can acess the properties or methods of an object using dot notation and you also access properties using square brackets.***

# Document object model
***The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.***

## THE DOM TREE 
***As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.***

## SELECTING ELEMENTS USING ID ATTRIBUTES
***get El ementByi d () allows you to select a single element node by specifying the value of its id attribute***

## LIVE & STATIC NODELISTS
- **In a live Nodelist, when your script updates the page, the Nodelist is updated at the same time. The methods beginning getEl ementsBy_ return live Node lists. They are also typically faster to generate than static Nodelists.**
- **In a static Nodelist when your script updates the page, the NodeList is not updated to reflect the changes made by the script**

## SELECTING AN ELEMENT FROM A NODELIST 
***There are two ways to select an element from a Nodelist:*** 
- **The item() method and array syntax.**
- **The get El ementsByCl ass Name()method allows you to select elements whose class attribute contains a specific value**
- **The get El ementsByTagName () method allows you to select elements using their tag name**
- **querySe 1 ector() returns the first element node that matches the CSS-style selector. querySe 1ectorA11 () returns a Nodelist of all of the matches**

## LOOPING THROUGH A NODELIST
***If you want to apply the same code to numerous elements, looping through a Nodelist is a powerful technique.***

## TRAVERSING THE DOM
***When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties. This is known as traversing the DOM.***

## WHITESPACE NODES
***Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements.***

## ACCESS & UPDATE TEXT WITH TEXTCONTENT
***The textContent property allows you to collect or update just the text that is in the containing element (and its children).***

## ACCESSING TEXT ONLY
***In order to demonstrate the difference between textContent and i nnerText, this example features a CSS rule to hide the contents of the < em > element.***

## ADDING ELEMENTS USING DOM MANIPULATION
***DOM manipulation offers another technique to add new content to a page (rather than innerHTML). It involves three steps:***
- **CREATE THE ELEMENT createEl ement ()**
- **GIVE IT CONTENT  createTextNode()**
- **ADD IT TO THE DOM appendChild()**

## REMOVING AN ELEMENT FROM THE DOM TREE
***removeCh i 1 d () method to remove the fourth item from the list (along with its contents).***

## CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS) ATTACKS 
***If you add HTML to a page using i nnerHTML (or several jQuery methods), you need to be aware of Cross-SiteScripting Attacks or XSS; otherwise, an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.***

## DEFENDING AGAINST CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING
***VALIDATE INPUT GOING TO THE SERVER ***
**Only let visitors input the kind of characters they need to when supplying information. This is known as validation.Do not allow untrusted users to submit HTML markup or JavaScript.**

## XSS: ESCAPING & CONTROLLING MARKUP
***Any content generated by users that contain characters that are used in code should be escaped on the server.You must control any markup added to the page.***

## EXAM INING THE DOM IN CHROME
***Modern browsers come with tools that help you inspect the page loaded in the browser and understand the structure of the DOM tree.***

## EXAMINING THE DOM IN FIREFOX
***Firefox has similar built-in tools, but you can also download a DOM inspector tool that shows the text nodes***
