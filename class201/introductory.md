# Structure
***Many web pages act like electronic versions of these documents. For example, newspapers show the same stories in print as they do on websites; you can apply for insurance over the web; and stores have online catalogs and e-commerce facilities.***

**So, in order to learn how to write web pages, it is very important to understand how to structure documents. In this chapter you will:**
- See how HTML describes the structure of a web page.
- Learn how tags or elements are added to your document.
- Write your first web page.

# Extra Markup
***At this point, we have covered the main tags that fit nicely into groups and sections.***
- DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
- You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
- The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
- The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
- <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
- The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©

# Process& Design
***It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.***

**here some notes to understand more:**
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
- You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# The ABC of programming
***They will be covered in three sections:*** 
- **A:What is a script and how do I create one?**
> A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal. 
- **B:How do computers fit in with  the world around them?**
> Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. 
- **C:How do I write a script for a web page?**
> To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
