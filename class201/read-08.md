## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
**CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.**

## Controlling the Position of Elements
- **Normal flow**
- **Relative Positioning**
- **Absolute positioning**
- **Fixed Positioning**
- **Floating Elements**

## Over lapping Elements
**z-index: When you use relative, fixed, or absolute positioning, boxes can overlap. If boxes do overlap, the elements that appear later in the HTML code sit on top of those that are earlier in the page.**

## Floating Element
**float: The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.**

## Page Sizes
**Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).**

## Fixed Width Layouts
**Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels.**

## Liquid Layouts
**Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.**

## Layout Grids
**Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements â€” how they are organized on a page. Many designers use a grid structure to help them position items on a page, and the same is true for web designers.**

## CSS Frameworks
**CSS frameworks aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on. You can include the CSS framework code in your projects rather than writing the CSS from scratch.**

## Multiple Style sheets
**link: On this page you can see the other technique for including multiple style sheets. Inside the '< head >' element is a separate '< link >' element for each style sheet.**
