# Comparison operators
***Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false.***

**Let's know some operators that helping us to write our code which is as follows:**
- ==(equal to)
- !=(not equal to)
- !==(strict not equal to)
- ===( strict equal to)
- (>) (greater than)
- < (less than)
- (>=) (greater than or equal to)
- <= (less than or equal to)

# Logical operators
***Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one Comparison operator.***

**We have three main logical operator as:**
1. &&(logical and) this operator tests more than one condition.
2. || (logical or) this operator tests at least one condition.
3. ! (not operator) this operator take a single boolean value and inverts it.

# loops
***Loops check a condition. if it returns true, a code block will run. Then the condition will be checked again and if it still returns true, the code block will run again. it repeats until the condition returns false.***

**There are three main types of loops which is as follows:**
1. For : if you need to run code a specific number of times.This loop made up of three statements(initialization(i=0),condition(i<10),update(i++))
2. While : if you do not know how many times the code should run and the code will continue to loop for as long as the condition is true.
3. Do while : is very similar to the while loop,but it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once,even if the condition evaluates to false.
