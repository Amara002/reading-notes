## Color

**How to specify colors, as there are three common ways in which you can indicate your choice of colors:**
- RGB: Values Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255. "rgb(102,205,170)"
- Hex Codes: Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code."#66cdaa"
- Color Names: Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number."MediumAquaMarine"
## Contrast

**When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.**
- Low Contrast: Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors. 
- High Contrast: Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
- Medium Contrast: For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.

## Opacity

***CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).***

***Color pickers can help you find the color you want.***
