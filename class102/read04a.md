# introdution of Javascript
***To make websites more interactive you should use Javascript language and you have to know how to develop your website, so let's how as:***
- Access content : You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page.
- Modify content : You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.
- Program rules  : You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page.
- React to events: You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.

# The A,B,C of Programming
***Firstly, let's talk about script and do we create one?***

### Definition of the script

**A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.**

### To write a script

**To write a script you should do in these instructions:**
1. Define the goal  : First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve. 
2. Design the script: You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task 
3. Code each step   : Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the computer understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

**This is demo to know how defining a goal & designing the script**

# Expressions
***An expression evaluates into a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions:***
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE: In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value. As you have seen, this is done using the assignment operator (the equals sign). 
var color = 'beige';
The value of co 1 or is now beige.
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE: You can perform operations on any number of 
individual values (see next page) to determine a single value. For example:
var area = 3 * 2;
The value of area is now 6.

### Definintion of operators
**Expressions rely on things called operators, they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.**

### Arithmetic operations 
**JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers. You may remember some from math class. you can know them from**
