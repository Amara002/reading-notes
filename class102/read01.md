Choosing the text editor

 Firstly, to know how to choose text editor you have to know what is that. the text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on tour computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site.now, let's us sign to some features that you should look for in a text editor which is as follows:

    Code completion.
    Syntax highlighting.
    A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue).
    The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.

Now, I will display some editors that you can apply the previously mentioned features:

   NotePad++, TextWrangler/BBEdit, VisualStudioCode, Atom, Brackets and SublimeText
TheDifferenceBetweenTextEditorsandIDEs

A text editor kind of gives away what it does in the title. it edits text.It also manages text, and manages files. I love that name “text wrangler” because in away that’s what really a text editor does. It wrangles your text together into something meaningful. An IDE(Integrated Development Environment) is really a suite of different software all coming together. An IDE is a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one software package.
Command line( its shoutcut is "GUI" graphical user interface)

the command line (terminal) is the command that you can prompt files or directories through and you can do alot of process through like:

    ls : list directories or files
    ls -la : list all files and directories
    cd : change directory , move its location
    mkdir : make a new directory
    ../.. : move back to the main directory
    touch : creat a new file
    / etc : it tells "ls" isn't to list our current directory but instead to list that directory content
    ls - l / etc  : lond list of the directory
    ls -a : list the contents of a directory, including hidden files
    pwd(print working directory) : to verify where we currently are

Types of paths

we can trace the file or the directory from the treminal by two paths which is as follows:

    Relative path: a file or directory location to where we currently
    absolute path: a file or directory in relation to the root of the file system

let's us show some shorcuts related with paths:

    ~(tilde) : to know your home directory
    .(dot) : to know your current directory
    ..(dotdot) : to know your parent directory
