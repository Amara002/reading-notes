# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack
***A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.***

***Common terminology for a stack is***

1. ***Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed***
2. ***Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.***
3. ***Top - This is the top of the stack.***
4. ***Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.***
5. ***IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.***

## FILO

***First In Last Out***
***This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.***

## Stack Visualization

### Push O(1)
***Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.***

### Pop O(1)
***Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top. When conducting a pop, the top Node will be re-assigned to the Node that lives below and the top Node is returned to the user.***

### Peek O(1)
***When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.***

### IsEmpty O(1)
***Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty***

## Queue Visualization

### Enqueue O(1)
***When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.***

### Dequeue O(1)
***When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue.***

### Peek O(1)
***When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.***

### IsEmpty O(1)
***Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty***
