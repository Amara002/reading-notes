# Monetization

### Best practices for setting your initial monetization strategy

- ***Research other apps in your category: Learn how other developers charge for their apps and content. Consider whether there are benefits to offering users alternative ways to pay.***
- ***Think about how your app will be used: Your app's usage patterns can indicate the best monetization choices. For apps with more casual usage, advertising and in-app purchases might be appropriate options. However, always consider offering an in-app purchase that removes ads.***
- ***Make use of natural extensions: If your app can be extended or expanded, such as with adding levels in a game, consider making the core app available for free and offering extended features through in-app purchases or subscriptions.***
- ***Consider your cost structures: If you have significant recurring content costs, consider using subscriptions. Use a free trial period to encourage uptake.***
- ***Consider your audience: For some audiences, the scope for using advertising, subscriptions, or in-app purchases can be limited. For example, users are more likely to pay for an ad-free, kid-friendly app than a casual use app. In these cases, premium (paid) apps are more appropriate.***
- ***Consider local factors when setting prices: When setting prices for apps, in-app purchases, or subscriptions in specific markets, be sure to consider cost of living differences, local pricing patterns, pricing of competitive apps, and other market factors.***

### Best practices for optimizing your monetization strategy

- ***Analyze statistics in the Google Play Console: Gain an understanding of your users' purchasing patterns, including statistics on average revenue per paying user and new versus returning buyers.***
- ***Understand purchasing behavior with Google Analytics for Firebase: With data on up to 500 in-app events, Google Analytics for Firebase can provide insights into user buying behavior.***
- ***Run pricing experiments: Use in-app A/B testing to experiment with different prices and alternative ways to encourage users to take up subscriptions or purchase in-app products.***
- ***Offer a sale price: Paid apps can use strikethrough pricing in the Play Console to offer a discounted price for a limited time and encourage more purchases.***
