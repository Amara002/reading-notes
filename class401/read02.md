# Packages and Import
- ***A package name is the same as the directory (folder) name which contains the .java files.***

- ***Imports:The JOptionPane class is in the swing package, which is located in the javax package. The wildcard character (<*>) is used to specify that all classes with that package are available to your program. This is the most common programming style.***

- ***NetBeans creates packages by default:***

  1. ***The project name is used as the default package name, but you can change it.***
  2. ***A directory / folder is created with this project name. This directory name is the name of your package.***
  3. ***A package declaration is automatically inserted into each new source file it creates.***
  4. ***When you build a main project, the double-clickable .jar file uses this project/package/directory name.***

- ***Static imports in Java 5 : Java 5 added an import static option that allows static variables (typically constants) to be referenced without qualifying them with a class name. For example,***
> import static java.awt.Color;
 
# Intro to Loops
***ooping is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions until the controlling Boolean-expression evaluates to false.***

### Definitions 
- ***A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing and evaluating a loop counter.***
- ***The while loop is Java's most fundamental loop statement. It repeats a statement or a block of statements while its controlling Boolean-expression is true.***
- ***The do-while loop works just like the while loop except for the fact that the first condition evaluation happens after the first iteration of the loop.***
