# Save data in a local database using Room

***The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. In particular, Room provides the following benefits:***

- ***Compile-time verification of SQL queries.***
- ***Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.***
- ***Streamlined database migration paths.***

***There are three major components in Room:***

- ***The database class that holds the database and serves as the main access point for the underlying connection to your app's persisted data.***
- ***Data entities that represent tables in your app's database.***
- ***Data access objects (DAOs) that provide methods that your app can use to query, update, insert, and delete data in the database.***
