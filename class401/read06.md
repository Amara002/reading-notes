# Inheritance and Interfaces

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
***We will introduce you to objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages.***
- ***An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.***
- ***A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.***
- ***Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.***
- ***An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world.***
- ***A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.***

## Interfaces and Inheritance
***That is, how a subclass can inherit fields and methods from a superclass. You will learn that all classes are derived from the Object class, and how to modify the methods that a subclass inherits from superclasses.***
