# OOP

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts
***We will introduce you to objects, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and packages.***
- ***An object is a software bundle of related state and behavior.***
- ***A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.***
- ***Inheritance provides a powerful and natural mechanism for organizing and structuring your software.***
- ***An interface is a contract between a class and the outside world.***
- ***A package is a namespace for organizing classes and interfaces in a logical manner.***

## Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers

### Decimals
***Every digit in a decimal number has a "position", and the decimal point helps us to know which position is.***

### Bases
***The Decimal Number System is also called "Base 10", because it is based on the number 10, with these 10 symbols:"0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9"***

### Binary Numbers
***Binary Numbers are just "Base 2" instead of "Base 10". So you start counting at 0, then 1, then you run out of digits ... so you start back at 0 again, but increase the number on the left by 1.***

### Hexadecimal Numbers
***Hexadecimal numbers are interesting. There are 16 of them!***
***They look the same as the decimal numbers up to 9, but then there are the letters ("A',"B","C","D","E","F") in place of the decimal numbers 10 to 15.***
